# strace
        Traces system calls in a specified program. 
        Usage: "strace ./[program to exacute]"

# ltrace
        Similar to strace but instead follows library calls.
        Usage: "ltrace ./[program to exacute]"
  
# gdb 
     GUNU Debugger, A basic debugger for linux.
     Usage: gdb [file to debug]
     
## Commands 
* disassemble [function]: Disassembles and displays the selected function. 
        
* set-disassembly-flavor [flavor]: Used to change the style of disassemble outputed.
       
* info registers: displays registers
        
* break *[function or address]: Sets a breakpoint that freezes program exacution when hit 
                                      allowing you to examine points of the program mid execution.
                                      
* si: Steps one instruction. Follows function calls.
        
* ni: Steps one instruction. Does not follow function calls. (TO repeat, you can just hit 
            ENTER instead of typing the command again.)
            
* run [input/parameters]: Runs the program loaded in gdb. 
        
* continue: Runs program until next breakpoint.
        
* set [variale] [expression]: Used to set the value of a variable. ("set $eax=0" changes eax
                                    to 0, modifying the rax registry.) 

# Radare2: A termainal based disassembler. 
      Usage: r2 [file to dissasemble]
       
## Commands:
* aaa: Atuomatically analyse and autoname functions

* afl: Print all functions found by radare2

* ?: Get info about characters you can use

* s: Seek to a location. For example s sym.main, seeks to the main function. 
           
* pdf: Print disasassembly of current function
          
* ood:
          
* VVV: Enter's visual mode displaying a the selected function in graph format. 
   * Move with arrow keys and slect boxes with tab and shift + tab. 
   * Selected blocks ban be moved with shift + hjkl.
   * Cycle through diffrent representations with p.
   * Display help with ? (R is most important)
         
* V!: Extra fancy mode 

* -d: Flag that starts radare in debug mode
   * db: Place breakpoint at  [address]
   * :: Enters command mode
   * dc: Run the program
   * s: Step instructions (used after a breakpoint, S to stay in function and not get side tracked)
   * dr: Prints registers
