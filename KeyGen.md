# Algorithm to Check Key

One way to make a program more secure is to not have the secret value in the binary itself. Instead the value of the input after passing through an algorithm is compared with the value of the secret doing the same. 

# Strengths

It protects the binary from basic strings style attacks.

# Weaknesses

The value that program is checking for can be learned and the algorithm reversed. This allows the creation of a keygen.
